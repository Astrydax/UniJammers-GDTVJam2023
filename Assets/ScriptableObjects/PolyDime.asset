  tip: Being a PolyDime (Poly Dimensional) Light warrior, you have a presence in
    both wdimensions at tall times. With brief concentration you ca neven see what
    is happening inthe other dimensin. This is a great ability that few PolyDimes
    achieve (especially at your level!). Be careful though becasue some of the obstacles
    in the other dimension can affect you in this!
